//The Final Countdown
//This is based on “Flexible Countdown”. The parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is essentially identical; don’t be thrown off! Given 4 parameters (param1,param2,param3,param4) , print the multiples of param1 , starting at param2 and extending to param3 . One exception: if a multiple is equal to param4 , then skip (don’t print) it. Do this using a WHILE . Given (3,5,17,9) , print 6,12,15 (which are all of the multiples of 3 between 5 and 17 , and excluding the value 9 ).


func finalCountdown(mult: Int, from: Int, to: Int, excluded: Int) {
    for int in from...to {
        if int % mult == 0 && int != excluded {
            print(int)
        }
    }
}

finalCountdown(mult: 3, from: 5, to: 17, excluded: 9)
